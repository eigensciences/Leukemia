PROTACs Used in the Study
This repository contains the SMILES representations of various PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) molecules utilized in the research study. PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase to a target protein, resulting in its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The study aims to investigate these PROTACs for their potential applications in targeted protein degradation.
